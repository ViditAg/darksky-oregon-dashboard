# API Documentation

This folder is for documenting the API endpoints and data contracts for the Oregon Dark Sky Dashboard project.

- For Flask: List all routes, request/response formats, and example payloads.
- For Dash/Streamlit: Document any custom API endpoints or data sources if applicable.

Add markdown files for each API or service as needed.
